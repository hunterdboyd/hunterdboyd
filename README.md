Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
üëã Hi there! I'm Hunter, a third-year Computer Engineering student at McMaster University. My journey through engineering has been a blend of curiosity, creativity, and a deep passion for technology.

About Me

üéì Education: Currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at McMaster University.

üíª Interests: I‚Äôm deeply fascinated by the intersections of hardware and software. I enjoy working on projects that push the boundaries of embedded systems, digital design, and AI integration. Whether it‚Äôs building a complex Verilog design or optimizing an algorithm for performance, I‚Äôm always up for a challenge.

‚öôÔ∏è Skills: 

Programming Languages: C/C++, Python, Verilog, VHDL, ARM Assembly, MATLAB

Tools: Git, Quartus, PSpice, VSCode, Excel

Areas of Expertise: Digital logic design, embedded systems, data structures and algorithms, AI-powered applications

Projects

I love applying what I learn in the classroom to real-world projects. Here are some highlights:

SnapWaste: An AI-powered web application designed to identify waste items and provide instructions for proper disposal.

Spatial Navigation System: Designed an embedded system for indoor mapping using the VL53L1X Time-of-Flight sensor and a stepper motor for 360-degree data acquisition. Programmed in C/C++ for microcontroller operation, with I2C for sensor communication and UART for PC interfacing. Developed a Python application for 3D visualization using Open3D.

Advanced Multiplayer Snake Game: A highly abstracted version of the classic Snake game, utilizing various data structures such as hashing, linked lists, and binary search trees in C++.

Get in Touch

I‚Äôm always excited to connect with fellow Engineers or colleagues whether it‚Äôs for collaboration, discussion, or just a chat. Feel free to reach out!
